    <p style="font-size: 3rem; text-align: center;">History of MSEUNG.dev</p>

    <p class="subheaders">2021:</p>
    <p>July 21: mseung.dev was created with the text, "mseung.dev"</p>
    <p>August 20: mseung.dev is now a blank grey box with a spinning circle in it. I think it is because I tried to put replit in the website.</p>
    <p>November 18: the site is "under construction by Max_AS."</p>
    <p>December 18: I copied my copied website onto mseung.dev. the one i copied it from is my old site.</p>

    <br>

    <p class="subheaders">2022:</p>
    <p>January 16: I created the first iteration of actual mseung.dev with 4 buttons and a different font. The first button I didnt copy was the skills site.</p>
    <p>February 16: Changed font to Poppins.</p>
    <p>March 18: Moved Skills as part of one of the main buttons. I added the Dinosaur Game and a secret game called "IN DEVELOPMENT."</p>
    <p>April 17: "IN DEVELOPMENT" is now Early Stock Trading Simulator.</p>
    <p>June 7: Released Stock Trading Simulator (Alpha) which has a lot of things I need to fix.</p>
    <p>August 28: Released Stock Trading Simulator (Alpha) but it works. I also added new skills.</p>

    <br>

    <p class="subheaders">2023:</p>
    <p>February 2: Revamped MSEUNG.dev mainpage</p>
